## Quick Intro
- **Computer Vision** is a field of AI tthat uses software to interpret visual input like images or images from video feeds. In Azure, you can use Azure AI Vision to implement various computer vision scenarios. 
    - **Image Anaysis** 
    - **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**
    - **Face Detection**
    - **Video Analysis**

We will cover image analysis in this section & how to build applications that use Azure AI Vision to analyze and extract information from images.

As shown in the image above, Azure AI service provides services that you can use to analyze images as well as:
