# What is AI?
No matter what your stance is on AI, it is here to stay. It covers a wide range of software technologies that enable applications to perform things that typically require human intelligence. AI is built upon machine learning modules that learn patterns from a lot of data. This helps them understand information, think about it, and give relevant responses.

**Tip:** If you see anything about "semantic relationships", just know that it refers to the connections in meaning. Swap "semantic" with **connection, pattern, or guess.**

## AI Features that developers can add into software applications

+ **Generative AI**: This can create new responses to everyday language. For example, a real estate software could automatically write property descriptions based on key details provided by the user. 
+ **Agents**: These are AI systems that can perform tasks on behalf of users. For instance, a virtual assistant can schedule meetings, set reminders, and manage emails.
+ **Computer Vision**: This enables applications to interpret & process visual information from images, videos, and even live camera streams. If you have ever used automated checkout in a grocery store, they are probably using computer vision to identify which product a customer has in their basket which eliminates the need to scan a barcode.
+ **Speech**: This ability recognizes and processes human speech. Digital assistants like Siri and Alexa allow people to asks questions or provide instructions by speaking into a microphone. In return, spoken output provides answers or confirmations. 
+ **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: This allows applications to understand and generate human language. NLP is used in chatbots, translation services, and sentiment analysis tools to help machines comprehend and respond to text in a way that is meaningful to users.
+ **Information extraction**: This uses computer vision, speech, and NLP to get key information from documents, forms, images, recordings, and other content. For example, an automated expense claims processing system can extract purchase dates, individual line item details, and total costs from a scanned receipt. 
+ **Decision support**: Uses historic data and learned correlations to make predictions that support business decesion making. Analyzing demographic and economic factors in a city to predict real estate market trends that inform pricing decisions. 

### Deep Dive into Generative AI

Generative AI is the latest and greatest tool that can create things, not just give answers. It works by using language models that understand and use human language. These models are trained on vast amounts of text data, allowing them to generate coherent and contextually relevant responses. This capability opens up new possibilities for applications in content creation, customer support, and more.

**Example** This is commonly used as "Hey chat, can you create a speech for my friend's birthday? Make it sentimental and talk about an inside joke we have involving windsurfing." 

**Example** "Can you create a picture of a sunset over the ocean with a silhouette of a windsurfer?"

**Example** "Can you help me code the front end of a web application that allows users to book windsurfing lessons?"

## Azure AI Services
Microsoft offers many cloud services for building, running, and managing AI solutions. Azure AI Services has ready-made API's and models you can plug into your applications without having to build them from scratch. You can think of these as Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) solutions because they are prebuilt, standardized services offerd by CSPs.
