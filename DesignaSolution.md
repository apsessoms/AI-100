# Designing a machine learning project

## Microsofts Approach
**Microsoft has a six step framework for designing a machine learning project:**
1. Define the problem
2. Get the data
3. Prepare the data
4. Train the model
5. Integrate the model
6. Monitor the model

### 1. Define the problem   
What is the problem you are trying to solve? How will you measure success when it comes to making a model? Think of this step as creating blueprints for a house. If you don't know what **the final house should look like**, it can be hard to pick appliances, colors, or design features. 

**Classification**: 
**Regression**:
**Time Series Forecasting**:
**Computer Vision**:
**Natural Language Processing**:

| Task | What it does | Example |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Classification  | Predicts a category  | "Does this patient have diabetes?" ✅Yes ❌No |
| Regression  | Predicts a number  | "What will the temperature be tomorrow?"  |
| Time Series Forecasting  | Predicts future values over time  | "What will the sales look next quarter?"  |
| Computer Vision  | Analyzes and interprets visual data  | "Is this image a cat or a dog?"  |
| Natural Language Processing  | Extracts meaning from **text**  | "What is the sentiment of this review?"  |

### Example - Predicting VM Costs in Azure

Your team wants to predict how much virtual machines will cost next month based on past usage data.
